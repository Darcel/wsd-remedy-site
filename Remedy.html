				<h3><strong>Acne Prone? Try Yeast!</strong></h3>

				excessive oil production.  When used topically it helps acne breakouts 
				by 14% according to a study in the <em>International Journal of 
				Dermatology</em>.  Mix 1tsp. powdered brewer's yeast into 2tsp. plain 
				yogurt. Spread on problem areas and leave on 10min before rinsing off. 
				Repeat every three to seven days.</p>

				<h3><strong>Rinse Away Dandruff With Green Tea!</strong></h3>
				<p>Polyphenols in green tea cut down on flakes by slowing overproduction 
				of skin cells. So before retiring to bed brew a cup of green tea, allow 
				it to cool then massage it into your hair and scalp and leave it on 
				overnight.<em>Make sure you brew a fresh pot every use due to green tea 
				losing its antioxidants after a few hours, suggests Stephen Hsu, Ph.D.</em></p>
